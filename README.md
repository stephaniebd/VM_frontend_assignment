# VM_frontend_assignment

This assignment was to build this page base on a template.

The requirements for this exercise were to:
- use Bulma CSS
- add missing elements
- add a section before the footer
- make the site responsive

What I added:
- items in the navbar
- a headline and button in hero
- a form

I had never used Bulma before, so it was interesting to learn a new framework.
